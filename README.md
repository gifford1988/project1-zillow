# Project-1

The project built a data set of viable information from the Zillow API as well as webscraping.  This information allowed a user to input there preferred qualifiers for a home and have the best home in a given area come up based on those qualifiers.  The inputs were weighted to reflect user preferences and the house.  The programs used were Python, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and API.
